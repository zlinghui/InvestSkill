# DCF Valuation

You are an expert financial analyst. Build a rigorous Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to estimate intrinsic value for US stocks, with full sensitivity analysis and three-scenario probability weighting.

## Data Source Protocol

Build the model from auditable inputs in this order:
1. SEC filings, annual reports, and XBRL facts for revenue, OCF, capex, debt, cash, taxes, and diluted shares
2. Company IR materials for guidance and scenario assumptions
3. Stable reference sources for treasury yields, share price, and other market inputs
4. Third-party portals only as a secondary cross-check

Do not rely on Yahoo Finance, Macrotrends, or similar JS-heavy / anti-bot pages as the primary source of base metrics. If market inputs are unavailable, use conservative ranges, show wider sensitivity, and state the missing data instead of fabricating precision.

In Claude Code, avoid default fetches to `macrotrends.net`, `marketwatch.com`, and `finance.yahoo.com`, and do not keep retrying `sec.gov` browse CGI pages after a 403. Prefer company annual reports, quarterly reports, earnings releases, and investor-relations materials.

Also avoid analyst / estimates pages on `bloomberg.com`, `tipranks.com`, `zacks.com`, and `seekingalpha.com`, and do not guess sibling paths such as `/analysis/`, `/earnings/`, `/segment/`, or `/revenue-by-segment/` after a 404.

## Overview

DCF is the gold standard for intrinsic value estimation. It answers the fundamental question: **"What is this business worth based on the future cash flows it will generate?"** Unlike relative valuation, DCF tells you what the business is actually worth in absolute terms — independent of market sentiment or peer group pricing.

DCF requires disciplined assumptions. Small changes in growth rate, margin, or discount rate assumptions compound significantly over a 10-year horizon. Always model three scenarios (Bull/Base/Bear) and provide a sensitivity table so assumptions are never presented as point estimates.

## Step-by-Step DCF Methodology

### Step 1: Establish Base Metrics

Collect and document the current baseline before projecting forward:

- **Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Free Cash Flow** = Operating Cash Flow − Capital Expenditures
- **Revenue base** (TTM revenue and most recent full fiscal year)
- **FCF margin** (TTM FCF / TTM Revenue × 100%)
- **Shares outstanding** (diluted — include unvested RSUs and options for SBC adjustment)
- **Net debt** = Total Debt − Cash & Cash Equivalents (negative net debt = net cash position)
- **Stock-Based Compensation (SBC)** — identify as a real dilutive cost; subtract from FCF if not already excluded
- **Effective tax rate** (TTM basis, normalize for one-time tax events)

### Step 2: Revenue Growth Projection (Years 1–10)

Use multiple anchors to triangulate a defensible growth assumption:

- **Segment approach**: Project each revenue segment separately when possible
- **Historical growth analysis**: 3yr, 5yr, and 10yr revenue CAGR as a baseline anchor
- **Analyst consensus estimates**: Use sell-side consensus for years 1–3 as a cross-check
- **Management guidance**: Forward revenue guidance and long-term targets
- **Industry growth rate**: Use as a ceiling anchor
- **Growth tapering**: Apply higher growth in years 1–5, decelerating in years 6–10 toward the terminal growth rate
- **Three scenarios**: Bull (market share gains, margin expansion), Base (historical trend), Bear (competitive pressure, macro headwinds)

### Step 3: FCF Margin Assumptions

Project future FCF margins based on operating leverage and business model dynamics:

- **Historical FCF margin trend** (expanding, stable, or compressing)
- **Operating leverage potential**: What fixed costs are being leveraged as revenue scales?
- **Capex intensity** (% of revenue): Increasing or decreasing?
- **Working capital changes**: Consumer or generator?
- **Normalize for one-time items**: Strip out litigation settlements, restructuring charges
- **SBC adjustment**: Subtract SBC from reported operating cash flow to get true economic FCF

### Step 4: Terminal Value Calculation

Terminal value represents all cash flows beyond the 10-year explicit forecast period:

- **Terminal growth rate (g)**: Typically 2–3% (anchored to nominal GDP growth). Never set g > WACC — this implies infinite value
- **Gordon Growth Model (preferred)**:
  ```
  TV = FCF₁₀ × (1 + g) / (WACC − g)
  ```
- **Exit Multiple Method (alternative)**:
  ```
  TV = FCFₙ × (EV / FCF exit multiple)
  ```
- **Terminal value as % of Enterprise Value**: If TV > 80% of total EV, flag explicitly and widen sensitivity range

### Step 5: WACC Calculation

**Cost of Equity (CAPM)**:
```
Ke = Rf + β × (Rm − Rf)
```
- Rf = Risk-free rate (current 10-year US Treasury yield)
- β = Stock beta (5-year monthly)
- Rm − Rf = Equity risk premium (use Damodaran's current ERP, historically 5–6%)
- Size premium: Add 0.5–2% for small/mid-cap companies

**Cost of Debt**:
```
Kd = (Interest Expense / Total Debt) × (1 − Effective Tax Rate)
```

**Capital Structure Weights** (use market value weights, not book value):
- E/V = Equity Market Cap / (Equity Market Cap + Total Debt)
- D/V = Total Debt / (Equity Market Cap + Total Debt)

**WACC Formula**:
```
WACC = Ke × (E/V) + Kd × (D/V)
```

**Typical WACC Ranges by Risk Profile**:
```
Risk Profile         WACC Range    Company Examples
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Low risk (utility)   6–8%          Regulated utilities, large cap staples
Medium risk          8–11%         Large cap tech, established growth
High risk            11–15%        Small cap, emerging market, cyclical
Very high risk       15–20%+       Early-stage, distressed, pre-revenue
```

### Step 6: Discount the Cash Flows

```
PV of Year n FCF = FCFₙ / (1 + WACC)ⁿ

PV of Terminal Value = TV / (1 + WACC)¹⁰

Enterprise Value = Σ PV(FCF years 1–10) + PV(Terminal Value)

Equity Value = Enterprise Value − Net Debt
  (add back net cash if company has net cash position)

Intrinsic Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding
```

**10-Year Cash Flow Projection Table**:
```
Year    Revenue ($M)    FCF Margin %    FCF ($M)    Discount Factor    PV of FCF ($M)
1       [value]         [%]             [value]     1/(1+WACC)¹        [value]
2       [value]         [%]             [value]     1/(1+WACC)²        [value]

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sum of PV (FCF)                                                         [value]
Terminal Value (PV)                                                     [value]
Enterprise Value                                                        [value]
Less: Net Debt                                                          [value]
Equity Value                                                            [value]
Shares Outstanding                                                      [value]
Intrinsic Value per Share                                               $[value]
```

### Step 7: Sensitivity Analysis

Always provide a 5×5 sensitivity table showing intrinsic value at different WACC and terminal growth rate combinations:

```
Sensitivity Table — Intrinsic Value per Share ($)

              Terminal Growth Rate
WACC     1.0%    1.5%    2.0%    2.5%    3.0%
6.0%     $xxx    $xxx    $xxx    $xxx    $xxx
7.0%     $xxx    $xxx    $xxx    $xxx    $xxx
8.0%     $xxx    $xxx    $xxx    $xxx    $xxx  ← Base Case
9.0%     $xxx    $xxx    $xxx    $xxx    $xxx
10.0%    $xxx    $xxx    $xxx    $xxx    $xxx

[*] Shaded cell = Base Case assumption
```

Interpretation guide:
- If the entire table shows a margin of safety vs. current price → high confidence in undervaluation
- If only a few cells show margin of safety → valuation depends critically on specific assumptions
- If no cells show margin of safety → stock is expensive under all reasonable scenarios

### Step 8: Margin of Safety Assessment

```
Margin of Safety = (Intrinsic Value − Market Price) / Intrinsic Value × 100%

Upside Potential = (Intrinsic Value − Market Price) / Market Price × 100%
```

**Assessment Scale**:
```
Margin of Safety    Assessment
>30% discount       Compelling value — strong margin of safety
10–30% discount     Fair value — reasonable entry for long-term investors
0–10% discount      Fairly priced — limited margin of safety
10–30% premium      Slightly expensive — requires strong growth conviction
>30% premium        Expensive — significant growth must materialize to justify price
>50% premium        Very expensive — priced for perfection; high risk
```

## Three-Scenario Framework

Always present three scenarios with explicit assumption differences:

```
Scenario    Probability    Revenue CAGR (Y1-5)    FCF Margin (Y5)    WACC    Terminal g
Bull         20%           [higher growth]         [higher margin]    [lower]  [2.5%]
Base         60%           [consensus growth]      [stable margin]    [base]   [2.0%]
Bear         20%           [lower growth]          [compressed]       [higher] [1.5%]

Intrinsic Value:
  Bull Case IV:    $[value]
  Base Case IV:    $[value]
  Bear Case IV:    $[value]

Probability-Weighted IV = (20% × Bull IV) + (60% × Base IV) + (20% × Bear IV) = $[value]
```

The probability-weighted IV is the primary output used for investment decision-making.

## Common DCF Pitfalls

1. **Garbage in, garbage out**: Extrapolating recent high-growth rates too far into the future. Be conservative, especially in years 6–10.
2. **Terminal value dominance**: If TV > 70% of enterprise value, stress-test terminal assumptions aggressively.
3. **WACC too low**: Ignoring size/liquidity premiums for smaller companies artificially inflates intrinsic value.
4. **Ignoring cyclicality**: Using peak FCF margins for a cyclical business. Always normalize FCF through a full business cycle.
5. **Ignoring stock-based compensation**: SBC is a real, dilutive cost. Subtract from operating cash flow.
6. **Single scenario thinking**: Always run Bull, Base, and Bear scenarios.
7. **Hidden working capital and capex changes**: Rapidly growing companies often consume significant working capital.
8. **Currency and geographic mix**: For international businesses, project by geography with appropriate discount rates.

## DCF vs. Relative Valuation

**When DCF is most reliable**:
- Stable, mature businesses with predictable, consistent FCF
- Asset-light businesses with high FCF conversion (software, consumer brands)
- Companies with 10+ years of FCF generation history

**When DCF is less reliable**:
- Early-stage growth companies with no positive FCF
- Highly cyclical businesses where normalizing FCF requires significant judgment
- Financial companies (banks, insurance, REITs) — use Price/Book, Price/Earnings, or dividend discount models
- Turnaround situations where the path to profitability is uncertain
