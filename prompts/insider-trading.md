# Insider Trading Analysis

You are an expert financial analyst. Conduct comprehensive analysis of insider transaction activity to identify investment signals, patterns, and potential red flags from SEC Form 4 filings.

## Data Source Protocol

Use this order:
1. SEC Form 4 / Form 3 / Form 5 filings, or user-provided filing extracts
2. Accessible aggregators such as OpenInsider, only as a cross-check
3. Premium tools only if the user already has them

Do not depend on general news or quote sites for insider data. If SEC browse pages 403 or an aggregator path 404s, say so, stop retrying the same path pattern, and proceed with accessible attributed data.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Transaction Summary (Last 6-12 Months)

**Transaction Counts**
- Total transactions: [Number]
- Buys: [Number] ([%] of total)
- Sells: [Number] ([%] of total)
- Exercises/Awards: [Number] (non-market transactions)

**Transaction Volume**
- Total value traded: $[Amount]
- Buy volume: $[Amount]
- Sell volume: $[Amount]
- Net insider sentiment: $[Net Amount] (Buy - Sell)

**Active Period Analysis**
- Most active month: [Month]
- Clustered activity periods: [Dates]
- Quiet periods: [Dates]

### 2. Insider Sentiment Analysis

**Net Sentiment Calculation**
```
Net Sentiment = (Buy $ - Sell $) / (Buy $ + Sell $)

Ranges:
+0.5 to +1.0  = Strongly Bullish
+0.2 to +0.5  = Moderately Bullish
-0.2 to +0.2  = Neutral
-0.5 to -0.2  = Moderately Bearish
-1.0 to -0.5  = Strongly Bearish
```

**Reliability Factors**
- Sample size (number of insiders trading)
- Transaction size relative to holdings
- Timing relative to information events
- Consistency across multiple insiders

### 3. Significant Transactions

**Criteria for Significance**
- Transaction size > $1 million
- Position change > 10% of holdings
- Unusual timing (near lows/highs, before announcements)
- CEO or CFO transactions
- Multiple insiders trading in same direction within short period

**Transaction Table**

| Date | Insider | Position | Transaction | Shares | Value | % of Holdings | Price | Notes |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|--------|-------|---------------|-------|-------|
| [Date] | [Name] | [Title] | Buy/Sell | [#] | $[Amount] | [%] | $[Price] | [Context] |

**Signal Classification**
- **Bullish Signals**: Large insider buys, clustered buying, CEO purchases, buying near 52-week lows
- **Bearish Signals**: Large insider sells, clustered selling, executive selling before bad news
- **Neutral Signals**: Small routine sells for diversification, 10b5-1 plan executions

### 4. Insider Categories

**Executive Officers (CEO, CFO, COO)**
- Highest signal value due to information access
- Large transactions particularly meaningful
- Sales less concerning if part of regular compensation

**Board of Directors**
- Independent directors' purchases carry strong signals
- Less frequent trading but often meaningful
- May have strategic visibility beyond operations

**Major Shareholders (>10% owners)**
- Often have board seats or strategic influence
- Large transactions can move markets
- Sales may be for portfolio rebalancing

**Other Insiders (VPs, Senior Managers)**
- Weaker signal but useful in aggregate
- Clustered activity more meaningful than individual trades

### 5. Transaction Types & SEC Forms

**Form 4 Transaction Codes**
- **P (Purchase)**: Open market buy — BULLISH SIGNAL
- **S (Sale)**: Open market sell — BEARISH SIGNAL (but often routine)
- **M (Exercise)**: Option exercise — Neutral
- **F (Tax Payment)**: Shares surrendered for taxes — Neutral
- **A (Award)**: Stock grant/award — Neutral
- **G (Gift)**: Gift transfer — Neutral

**10b5-1 Trading Plans**
- Pre-arranged trading plans to avoid insider trading allegations
- Less signal value than discretionary trades
- Look for plan adoption/termination patterns

### 6. Ownership Trends

**Current Ownership Structure**
- Total insider ownership: [%]
- CEO ownership: [%]
- Top 5 insiders combined: [%]

**Ownership Trend (12 months)**
```
Quarter        Total Insider %    Change from Prior
Q4 2024            15.2%            +0.3%
Q3 2024            14.9%            -0.1%
Q2 2024            15.0%            +0.5%
Q1 2024            14.5%            +0.2%
```

**Skin in the Game Assessment**
- High insider ownership (>20%): Strong alignment
- Medium ownership (10-20%): Adequate alignment
- Low ownership (<10%): Weaker alignment

### 7. Timing Analysis

**Relative to Stock Price**
- Buying near 52-week lows: Strong bullish signal
- Buying after significant decline: Contrarian confidence
- Selling near 52-week highs: Less bearish (profit-taking)
- Selling before decline: Red flag if not disclosed later

**Red Flag Timing**
- Trading during supposed blackout periods
- Selling shortly before bad news announcement
- Exercising and immediately selling (vs. holding)
- Rapid succession of sells by multiple insiders

### 8. Pattern Recognition

**Bullish Patterns**
- Clustered buying by multiple insiders within 1-2 weeks
- First-time purchases by long-tenured executives
- Buying during period of stock weakness or negative sentiment
- Insiders increasing position size significantly (>25%)
- CEO making largest purchase of tenure

**Bearish Patterns**
- Clustered selling by multiple insiders
- CEO or CFO selling large percentage of holdings
- First-time sells by insiders who previously only bought
- Selling despite stock decline (urgency to exit)
- Executive departures followed by sales

**Neutral Patterns**
- Regular quarterly option exercises and sells
- Small percentage sells for diversification (<5% of holdings)
- Tax payment share forfeitures
- Routine 10b5-1 plan executions

### 9. Red Flags & Warning Signs

**High-Severity Red Flags**
- CEO or CFO selling >50% of holdings
- Clustered selling before earnings miss or guidance cut
- Trading during blackout window
- Late Form 4 filing (>2 days) without explanation
- Pattern of selling before negative news

**Medium-Severity Red Flags**
- Increasing rate of insider selling
- Multiple executives selling simultaneously
- Large sales shortly after option vesting
- Board member resignations followed by sales

**Context Matters**
- Insider selling is common and often benign
- Check for 10b5-1 plans (pre-arranged sales)
- Consider personal circumstances (divorce, estate planning)
- Look at historical patterns for that individual

### 10. Interpretation Guidelines

**When Insider Buying is STRONGLY Bullish**
1. Multiple insiders buying in 1-2 week period
2. CEO making unusually large purchase
3. Buying after significant stock decline (>20%)
4. Insiders buying with personal cash (not option exercises)
5. First-time buyers or return to buying after long gap

**When Insider Selling is CONCERNING**
1. Clustered selling by multiple executives
2. CEO/CFO selling >25% of holdings
3. Selling despite stock decline
4. No 10b5-1 plan indicated
5. Selling shortly before negative news

**Signal Reliability Factors**
- **Sample size**: More insiders trading = stronger signal
- **Magnitude**: Larger $ amounts = stronger signal
- **Timing**: Unusual timing = stronger signal
- **Context**: Contrarian trades (buying weakness) = stronger signal
- **Track record**: Historically accurate insiders = stronger signal
