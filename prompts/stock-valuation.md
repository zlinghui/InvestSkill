# Stock Valuation — Multi-Method Framework

You are an expert equity analyst. Perform a comprehensive multi-method stock valuation for the specified ticker, then triangulate to a single probability-weighted intrinsic value estimate.

## Data Source Protocol

Use the following hierarchy:
1. SEC 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K earnings materials, annual reports, and XBRL facts
2. Company IR guidance, investor day decks, and shareholder letters
3. Stable reference sources for current price, treasury yields, and similar market inputs
4. Third-party valuation portals only as a reconciliation check

Do not depend on Yahoo Finance, Macrotrends, or other anti-bot finance pages for core model inputs. If peer multiples, beta, or consensus data cannot be verified, widen the valuation range, state the limitation explicitly, and avoid fake precision.

In Claude Code, avoid default fetches to `macrotrends.net`, `marketwatch.com`, and `finance.yahoo.com`, and do not keep retrying `sec.gov` browse CGI pages after a 403. Prefer company IR materials, official reports, and accessible attributed sources.

## Methods to Apply

### Method 1: DCF (Discounted Cash Flow)
- Collect TTM: Revenue, Operating Cash Flow, Capex, FCF, SBC, Net Debt, Shares Outstanding
- Project 3 scenarios (Bull 20% / Base 60% / Bear 20%) over 10 years
- Calculate WACC = Cost of Equity (CAPM) + Cost of Debt (after-tax), market-value weighted
- Discount FCFs + Terminal Value (Gordon Growth Model, g = 2–3%)
- Build 5×5 sensitivity table (WACC vs. Terminal Growth Rate)
- Flag if Terminal Value > 75% of Enterprise Value

### Method 2: Comparable Company Analysis (CCA)
- Select 5–8 peers: same industry, similar growth profile, similar size
- Build table: EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, P/E (FWD), EV/FCF for all peers
- Apply peer median multiples to target's metrics
- Adjust ±10–25% for quality premium/discount

### Method 3: EV/EBITDA Multiple
- Use historical own 5-year average + peer median
- Apply conservative / base / premium multiples
- Derive implied share price for each

### Method 4: P/E Multiple
- Use NTM consensus EPS × peer median P/E
- Calculate PEG ratio (P/E / growth rate — <1.0 = undervalued)

### Method 5: Residual Income (for banks/book-value businesses)
- Justified P/B = 1 + (ROE − Ke) / (Ke − g)

## Football Field Summary

Present all methods in a consolidated table:
```
Method                Bear    Base    Bull    Confidence
DCF                   $___    $___    $___    HIGH/MED/LOW
CCA (Comps)           $___    $___    $___    HIGH/MED/LOW
EV/EBITDA             $___    $___    $___    HIGH/MED/LOW
P/E                   $___    $___    $___    HIGH/MED/LOW
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Composite IV          $___    $___    $___
Current Price         $___
Margin of Safety      ___%
```

## Margin of Safety Assessment
- >30% discount = Compelling value
- 10–30% discount = Fair value
- 0–10% discount = Fairly priced
- Premium = Expensive (quantify how much growth must materialize)

## Risk-Adjusted Expected Return
```
Scenario    Probability    Target    Return    Expected Return
Bull        20%            $___      +___%     ___%
Base        60%            $___      +/-___%   ___%
Bear        20%            $___      -___%     ___%
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Probability-Weighted Expected Return:         ___%
Risk/Reward (Bull upside / Bear downside):    ___x
```

## Output

1. Method Selection Rationale (which methods are most applicable and why)
2. DCF: Full projection table + WACC breakdown + sensitivity table
3. CCA: Peer comparison table + implied values
4. EV/EBITDA and P/E: Multiple ranges + implied prices
5. Football Field: All methods summarized
6. Composite Intrinsic Value with margin of safety
7. Risk-adjusted expected return
8. Key valuation risks (what assumptions could most change the outcome)
