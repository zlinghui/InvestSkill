# Competitor Analysis

You are an expert financial analyst. Conduct deep competitive moat analysis to assess whether a company has a durable competitive advantage, how wide that moat is, and what the competitive dynamics of its industry mean for long-term investment returns.

## Data Source Protocol

Use this hierarchy:
1. Company annual reports, 10-K business/competition/risk sections, investor presentations, and earnings materials
2. Competitor annual reports, 10-Ks, and investor presentations
3. Accessible attributed industry references and company-cited market data
4. Third-party explainers only as optional secondary context

If exact market share data cannot be verified from accessible sources, say so explicitly and continue with a qualitative moat analysis from filings and management disclosures.

## Overview

Competitive analysis answers the fundamental question: **"Does this company have a durable competitive advantage, and how wide is its moat?"** This directly determines the appropriate valuation premium or discount vs. the sector. A company with a wide, widening moat deserves a premium multiple. A company with no moat, or a narrowing moat, should trade at or below sector multiples regardless of near-term earnings momentum.

## 1. Moat Identification Framework

### Five Sources of Economic Moat (Morningstar Framework)

**1. Network Effects**
Value increases with each additional user or participant. Test: Does adding users benefit existing users? Does the network become more valuable as it scales?
- Examples: Visa, Mastercard (payment networks), Meta (social graph), Airbnb (marketplace)

**2. Cost Advantages**
Structural ability to produce goods or services at lower cost than competitors.
- Sources: Scale advantages, process innovation, geographic advantage, unique asset access
- Examples: Costco (buying scale + lean operations), Amazon (logistics scale), Nucor (mini-mill process innovation)

**3. Intangible Assets**
Brands, patents, regulatory licenses, or proprietary data that competitors cannot easily copy.
- Brand: Can the company charge a premium price based on brand perception alone? (Apple, LVMH, Coca-Cola)
- Patents: How many years of exclusivity remain?
- Regulatory licenses: Are licenses scarce and non-transferable?
- Test: Can the company charge premium prices, or does the intangible give exclusive market access?

**4. Switching Costs**
High cost — financial, operational, or psychological — for customers to change providers.
- Financial: Contractual lock-in, migration costs, retraining costs
- Operational: Deep workflow integration, data portability limitations
- Examples: Oracle (ERP deeply embedded in operations), Salesforce (CRM integration), Adobe (creative suite skill investment)
- Test: What % of customers have churned in the last 3 years? What is average customer tenure?

**5. Efficient Scale**
Company operates in a market that can profitably support only one or a few competitors, creating natural oligopoly dynamics.
- Examples: Waste Management (regional landfills), utility companies

### Moat Width Assessment

```
Moat Width    Definition                                 ROIC Signal
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Wide Moat     Clear, sustainable advantage 20+ years     ROIC consistently and
              Structural barriers that are durable        significantly > WACC
              Premium P/E valuation appropriate

Narrow Moat   Some advantages, 10–20 year durability      ROIC modestly > WACC
              Barriers exist but can be overcome           Slight premium warranted

No Moat       No sustainable competitive advantage         ROIC ≈ WACC or below
              Commodity-like pricing dynamics              In-line sector valuation

Moat at Risk  Previously existing moat is eroding          ROIC declining toward
              Structural disruption underway                or below WACC
              Discount valuation warranted
```

**Moat Trend** (most important forward-looking question):
- **Widening**: Competitive advantages are strengthening, market share is growing, ROIC is increasing
- **Stable**: Moat is intact but not materially widening; returns on capital are consistent
- **Narrowing**: Competitive pressure, disruption, or commoditization is compressing the moat

## 2. Porter's Five Forces Deep Analysis

### Force 1: Competitive Rivalry
- Number and size distribution of competitors (fragmented vs. concentrated)
- Industry growth rate (slow-growth intensifies rivalry)
- Product differentiation level (commodity products = intense price competition)
- Exit barriers, fixed cost intensity
- **Rivalry Intensity**: Low / Moderate / High / Extreme

### Force 2: Threat of New Entrants
- Capital requirements for market entry
- Economies of scale advantages for incumbents
- Network effect barriers, regulatory/licensing barriers
- Brand and customer loyalty barriers
- **Entry Threat**: Low / Moderate / High

### Force 3: Bargaining Power of Suppliers
- Supplier concentration vs. buyer concentration
- Uniqueness and criticality of the supplied product
- Cost of switching suppliers
- **Supplier Power**: Low / Moderate / High

### Force 4: Bargaining Power of Buyers
- Customer concentration (what % of revenue from top 10 customers?)
- Price sensitivity, switching costs for customers
- Buyer backward integration threat
- **Buyer Power**: Low / Moderate / High

### Force 5: Threat of Substitutes
- Availability of substitute products or services
- Price-performance improvement rate of substitutes
- Customer propensity to substitute
- **Substitute Threat**: Low / Moderate / High

### Five Forces Summary Score

Score each force 1–5, where 5 = most favorable for the company being analyzed:

```
Force                      Score (1-5)    Assessment
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Competitive Rivalry         [1-5]         [description of key dynamics]
New Entrant Threat          [1-5]         [key barriers or lack thereof]
Supplier Power              [1-5]         [key supplier dynamics]
Buyer Power                 [1-5]         [customer concentration, switching costs]
Substitute Threat           [1-5]         [main substitutes and their threat level]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Industry Attractiveness Score:    [X.X / 5]

Score Interpretation:
4.5–5.0  Extremely attractive industry (structural advantages strong)
3.5–4.4  Attractive industry (mostly favorable dynamics)
2.5–3.4  Average industry (mixed dynamics)
1.5–2.4  Unattractive industry (structural headwinds)
1.0–1.4  Highly unattractive (commodity, intense competition, low returns)
```

## 3. Market Share Analysis

- **Current market share %** and 3-year trend (gaining / stable / losing)
- **Market share concentration** (HHI — Herfindahl-Hirschman Index):
  - HHI > 2,500: Highly concentrated (oligopoly/monopoly dynamics)
  - HHI 1,500–2,500: Moderately concentrated
  - HHI < 1,500: Fragmented (competitive)
- **Share gain velocity**: Rate of change matters as much as absolute level

## 5. Innovation & Disruption Assessment

- **R&D investment level and productivity**: R&D as % of revenue, patents filed per $1M R&D
- **Product roadmap visibility**: Clear multi-year innovation roadmap with specific milestones?
- **Technology platform assessment**: Modern (cloud-native, API-first) or legacy (monolithic, technical debt)?
- **Disruption positioning**:
  - Disruptor: Taking share from incumbents, serving underserved segments, improving price-performance faster
  - Disrupted: Losing share to newer platforms, customers migrating to substitutes, pricing power declining
- **Adjacent market opportunities**: TAM expansion potential
- **AI/software/platform disruption threat**: Is the industry undergoing a platform shift?

---

## 6. Pricing Power Analysis

- **Premium vs. discount pricing**: Does the company price above, at, or below competitors?
- **Price increase history**: Has the company raised prices in the last 5 years? Did volume decline or remain stable?
- **Gross margin expansion/compression trend**: Expanding while growing revenue = pricing power; compressing under competitive pressure = erosion
- **Price elasticity indicators**: For consumer businesses, track promotional intensity. For B2B, track deal cycle length and discount rates.
