# Insider Trading Analysis

Comprehensive analysis of insider transaction activity to identify investment signals, patterns, and potential red flags from SEC Form 4 filings.

## Data Source Protocol

Use insider-trading sources in this order:

1. **Primary source**: SEC Form 4 / Form 3 / Form 5 filings, or user-provided filing extracts / transaction tables.
2. **Accessible aggregators**: OpenInsider or other reachable Form 4 summaries, only as cross-checks against the filing record.
3. **Premium tools**: Mention only if the user already has access or explicitly asks.

Do not depend on news sites or general quote pages for insider data. If the official SEC browse endpoint is inaccessible in Claude Code, continue with user-provided filing data or another accessible, attributed insider-transaction source and lower confidence as needed.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Transaction Summary (Last 6-12 Months)

Provide overview of insider trading activity:

**Transaction Counts**
- Total transactions: [Number]
- Buys: [Number] ([%] of total)
- Sells: [Number] ([%] of total)
- Exercises/Awards: [Number] (non-market transactions)

**Transaction Volume**
- Total value traded: $[Amount]
- Buy volume: $[Amount]
- Sell volume: $[Amount]
- Net insider sentiment: $[Net Amount] (Buy - Sell)

**Active Period Analysis**
- Most active month: [Month]
- Clustered activity periods: [Dates]
- Quiet periods: [Dates]

### 2. Insider Sentiment Analysis

Calculate and interpret net insider sentiment:

**Net Sentiment Calculation**
```
Net Sentiment = (Buy $ - Sell $) / (Buy $ + Sell $)

Ranges:
+0.5 to +1.0  = Strongly Bullish
+0.2 to +0.5  = Moderately Bullish
-0.2 to +0.2  = Neutral
-0.5 to -0.2  = Moderately Bearish
-1.0 to -0.5  = Strongly Bearish
```

**Sentiment Context**
- Current sentiment vs. historical baseline
- Sentiment trend (improving/deteriorating)
- Significance level (number and size of transactions)
- Comparison to peer company insiders

**Reliability Factors**
- Sample size (number of insiders trading)
- Transaction size relative to holdings
- Timing relative to information events
- Consistency across multiple insiders

### 3. Significant Transactions

Highlight meaningful insider trades:

**Criteria for Significance**
- Transaction size > $1 million
- Position change > 10% of holdings
- Unusual timing (near lows/highs, before announcements)
- CEO or CFO transactions
- Multiple insiders trading in same direction within short period

**For Each Significant Transaction**

| Date | Insider | Position | Transaction | Shares | Value | % of Holdings | Price | Notes |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|--------|-------|---------------|-------|-------|
| [Date] | [Name] | [Title] | Buy/Sell | [#] | $[Amount] | [%] | $[Price] | [Context] |

**Transaction Analysis**
- **Bullish Signals**: Large insider buys, clustered buying, CEO purchases, buying near 52-week lows
- **Bearish Signals**: Large insider sells, clustered selling, executive selling before bad news
- **Neutral Signals**: Small routine sells for diversification, 10b5-1 plan executions

### 4. Insider Categories

Analyze transactions by insider role:

**Executive Officers (CEO, CFO, COO)**
- Highest signal value due to information access
- Large transactions particularly meaningful
- Sales less concerning if part of regular compensation

**Board of Directors**
- Independent directors' purchases carry strong signals
- Less frequent trading but often meaningful
- May have strategic visibility beyond operations

**Major Shareholders (>10% owners)**
- Often have board seats or strategic influence
- Large transactions can move markets
- Sales may be for portfolio rebalancing

**Other Insiders (VPs, Senior Managers)**
- Weaker signal but useful in aggregate
- Clustered activity more meaningful than individual trades
- May indicate operational knowledge

### 5. Transaction Types & SEC Forms

Interpret different transaction codes:

**Form 4 Transaction Codes**
- **P (Purchase)**: Open market buy - BULLISH SIGNAL
- **S (Sale)**: Open market sell - BEARISH SIGNAL (but often routine)
- **M (Exercise)**: Option exercise - Neutral
- **F (Tax Payment)**: Shares surrendered for taxes - Neutral
- **A (Award)**: Stock grant/award - Neutral
- **G (Gift)**: Gift transfer - Neutral
- **D (Disposition)**: Return to company - Neutral

**Form 3 vs. Form 4 vs. Form 5**
- **Form 3**: Initial statement of beneficial ownership (new insider)
- **Form 4**: Changes in ownership (filed within 2 business days)
- **Form 5**: Annual statement of changes (deferred reporting)

**10b5-1 Trading Plans**
- Pre-arranged trading plans to avoid insider trading allegations
- Marked in filings if transaction was under 10b5-1
- Less signal value than discretionary trades
- Look for plan adoption/termination patterns

### 6. Ownership Trends

Track changes in insider ownership percentage:

**Current Ownership Structure**
- Total insider ownership: [%]
- CEO ownership: [%]
- Top 5 insiders combined: [%]

**Ownership Trend (12 months)**
```
Quarter        Total Insider %    Change from Prior
Q4 2024            15.2%            +0.3%
Q3 2024            14.9%            -0.1%
Q2 2024            15.0%            +0.5%
Q1 2024            14.5%            +0.2%
```

**Interpretation**
- **Increasing ownership**: Insiders accumulating = Bullish
- **Stable ownership**: Confidence maintained = Neutral to Bullish
- **Decreasing ownership**: Distribution = Bearish (but check reasons)

**Skin in the Game Assessment**
- High insider ownership (>20%): Strong alignment
- Medium ownership (10-20%): Adequate alignment
- Low ownership (<10%): Weaker alignment
- CEO ownership relative to compensation

### 7. Timing Analysis

Evaluate timing of insider transactions:

**Relative to Stock Price**
- Buying near 52-week lows: Strong bullish signal
- Buying after significant decline: Contrarian confidence
- Selling near 52-week highs: Less bearish (profit-taking)
- Selling before decline: Red flag if not disclosed later

**Relative to Information Events**
- Before earnings release
- Before major announcements (M&A, product launches)
- During blackout periods (should be restricted)
- After significant news (reaction to public information)

**Seasonal Patterns**
- Post-earnings window trading (common)
- Year-end tax-loss selling
- Quarterly option exercise cycles
- Annual equity grant patterns

**Red Flag Timing**
- Trading during supposed blackout periods
- Selling shortly before bad news announcement
- Exercising and immediately selling (vs. holding)
- Rapid succession of sells by multiple insiders

### 8. Pattern Recognition

Identify meaningful patterns in trading activity:

**Bullish Patterns**
- Clustered buying by multiple insiders within 1-2 weeks
- First-time purchases by long-tenured executives
- Buying during period of stock weakness or negative sentiment
- Insiders increasing position size significantly (>25%)
- CEO making largest purchase of tenure

**Bearish Patterns**
- Clustered selling by multiple insiders
- CEO or CFO selling large percentage of holdings
- First-time sells by insiders who previously only bought
- Selling despite stock decline (urgency to exit)
- Executive departures followed by sales

**Neutral Patterns**
- Regular quarterly option exercises and sells
- Small percentage sells for diversification (<5% of holdings)
- Tax payment share forfeitures
- Routine 10b5-1 plan executions
- Gift transfers to family trusts

### 9. Red Flags & Warning Signs

Identify concerning patterns:

**High-Severity Red Flags**
- CEO or CFO selling >50% of holdings
- Clustered selling before earnings miss or guidance cut
- Trading during blackout window
- Late Form 4 filing (>2 days) without explanation
- Pattern of selling before negative news

**Medium-Severity Red Flags**
- Increasing rate of insider selling
- Multiple executives selling simultaneously
- Selling despite recent insider buying by others
- Large sales shortly after option vesting
- Board member resignations followed by sales

**Context Matters**
- Insider selling is common and often benign
- Check for 10b5-1 plans (pre-arranged sales)
- Consider personal circumstances (divorce, estate planning)
- Look at historical patterns for that individual
- Assess whether selling is proportional to holdings

## Interpretation Guidelines

### When Insider Buying is STRONGLY Bullish
1. Multiple insiders buying in 1-2 week period
2. CEO making unusually large purchase
3. Buying after significant stock decline (>20%)
4. Insiders buying with personal cash (not option exercises)
5. First-time buyers or return to buying after long gap

### When Insider Buying is MODERATELY Bullish
1. Single insider making meaningful purchase
2. Regular accumulation pattern
3. Buying at all-time highs (conviction in further growth)
4. Board member purchases

### When Insider Selling is LESS Concerning
1. 10b5-1 pre-arranged plan sales
2. Small percentage of holdings (<5%)
3. Regular quarterly pattern
4. Diversification after large stock appreciation
5. Tax payments or estate planning

### When Insider Selling is CONCERNING
1. Clustered selling by multiple executives
2. CEO/CFO selling >25% of holdings
3. Selling despite stock decline
4. No 10b5-1 plan indicated
5. Selling shortly before negative news

### Signal Reliability Factors
- **Sample size**: More insiders trading = stronger signal
- **Magnitude**: Larger $ amounts = stronger signal
- **Timing**: Unusual timing = stronger signal
- **Context**: Contrarian trades (buying weakness) = stronger signal
- **Track record**: Historically accurate insiders = stronger signal

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Analysis
```
User: /insider-trading NVDA

Claude: Analyzes last 6 months of NVDA insider activity, identifies:
- Net bullish sentiment ($15M in buys vs. $2M in sells)
- CEO purchased $5M at $450/share (now $600)
- 4 VPs also bought in same 2-week window
- Signal: Moderately Bullish, Confidence: High
```

### Example 2: Before Earnings
```
User: /insider-trading AAPL --period "before-earnings"

Claude: Analyzes trading in 30-60 days before recent earnings:
- No unusual activity (good sign - no exits before announcement)
- Regular 10b5-1 sales only
- Signal: Neutral (no red flags)
```

### Example 3: Red Flag Detection
```
User: /insider-trading ABC --focus red-flags

Claude: Specifically looks for warning signs:
- CFO sold 60% of holdings last month
- 3 board members resigned and sold within 1 week
- Selling accelerated despite 30% stock decline
- Signal: BEARISH, Confidence: HIGH - Recommend caution
```

## Integration Notes

- Combine with /fundamental-analysis for complete due diligence
- Use /institutional-ownership for full insider + institutional picture
- Feed analysis to /report-generator for visual charts of insider activity
- Best used monthly or after significant insider filing activity
- Particularly valuable when analyzing small-mid cap stocks (insiders have more edge)
