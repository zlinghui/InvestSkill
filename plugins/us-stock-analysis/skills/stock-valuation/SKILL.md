description: Multi-method stock valuation using DCF, comparable company analysis, EV multiples, and residual income models
---

# Stock Valuation

Derive a rigorous intrinsic value estimate using multiple independent valuation methodologies, then triangulate to a single probability-weighted target price. Never rely on a single method — cross-validation across DCF, comparable company analysis (CCA), EV/EBITDA, and residual income models builds conviction and exposes assumption fragility.

## Data Source Protocol

Use a source hierarchy that prioritizes durability over convenience:

1. **Primary company financials**: SEC 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K earnings materials, annual reports, and XBRL facts for revenue, EBITDA, cash flow, debt, cash, tax rate, and diluted shares.
2. **Company guidance and IR materials**: Earnings decks, investor day presentations, and management guidance for scenario assumptions.
3. **Stable market inputs**: Current share price, treasury yields, and other reference data from clearly attributable sources.
4. **Third-party valuation portals**: Use only to cross-check multiples after the core inputs are built from primary sources.

Do **not** make Yahoo Finance, Macrotrends, or other anti-bot finance pages a hard dependency for valuation work. If those sites fail, proceed with SEC/IR-based modeling rather than aborting.

If peer multiples, beta, or consensus estimates are not available from reliable sources:
- Use a wider valuation range and state the limitation explicitly.
- Prefer simpler methods with auditable inputs over fake precision.
- Never invent missing market data just to fill every cell in the model.

### Claude Code Fetch Notes

In this environment, avoid default fetches to:
- `macrotrends.net` because 403 is common
- `marketwatch.com` because access may be blocked
- `finance.yahoo.com` because responses may be anti-bot shells or unstable HTML
- `sec.gov` browse CGI pages when they 403 under generic fetch clients

Prefer company IR filings, annual reports, earnings decks, and user-provided filing excerpts. If SEC is inaccessible, continue with accessible attributed sources and clearly flag the resulting confidence downgrade.

## Overview

Valuation is an art grounded in financial science. Each method has strengths and weaknesses depending on the business type, stage of maturity, and data availability. This skill applies four to five valuation methods, then reconciles them into a football field chart to show the implied value range. Wherever there is consensus across methods, conviction is high. Where methods diverge significantly, that gap tells you something important about market expectations.

## When to Use Each Method

```
Valuation Method          Best For                           Avoid For
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DCF (Free Cash Flow)      Mature, FCF-positive businesses    Pre-revenue, banks, REITs
Comparable Company (CCA)  Any publicly traded company        No good public comps
EV/EBITDA Multiple        Capital-intensive industrials      Asset-light, high-SBC tech
Price/Earnings (P/E)      Stable earnings businesses         Negative earnings
Price/Sales (P/S)         Revenue-stage growth companies     Mature high-margin businesses
EV/Revenue                High-growth, low-margin SaaS       Mature, cyclical businesses
Residual Income (RI)      Financial companies, book-value    Asset-light businesses
Dividend Discount (DDM)   Dividend-paying value stocks       Growth stocks, no dividend
Asset-Based NAV           Real estate, holding companies     Operating businesses
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## Method 2: Comparable Company Analysis (CCA)

Select 5–8 comparable public companies based on:
- Same industry and sub-industry
- Similar business model (SaaS vs. perpetual license, etc.)
- Similar growth profile (high-growth vs. mature)
- Similar size (market cap within 0.5–2.0x range preferred)

CCA Adjusted Implied Price:                              $___
```

**Premium/Discount Adjustment Factors:**
- Apply a +10–20% premium if the target has: superior growth, higher margins, stronger balance sheet
- Apply a -10–25% discount if: smaller/less liquid, weaker fundamentals, regulatory overhang

  Upside/Downside Potential:                 ___%
```

---

## Margin of Safety Framework

```
Margin of Safety = (Intrinsic Value − Market Price) / Intrinsic Value × 100%

Assessment:
>30% discount to IV    → Compelling value — strong margin of safety
10–30% discount        → Fair value — reasonable entry
0–10% discount         → Fairly priced — limited margin of safety
10–30% premium         → Slightly expensive — requires growth conviction
>30% premium           → Expensive — priced for perfection
>50% premium           → Very expensive — significant risk of multiple compression

Investor Type Minimums:
  Deep Value:       25–35% margin of safety required
  GARP:             10–20% margin of safety
  Growth:           0–10% (or slight premium for high-quality growth)
  Momentum:         Not applicable
