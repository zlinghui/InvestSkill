# US Stock Evaluation

Perform comprehensive stock evaluation combining fundamental analysis, valuation modeling, quality scoring, and risk assessment to produce investment-grade conclusions.

## Data Source Protocol

Before calculating ratios or valuation, collect inputs using this order:

1. **Official company filings**: SEC 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, annual reports, and XBRL facts for revenue, margins, debt, cash flow, share count, and tax rate.
2. **Company IR materials**: Earnings releases, investor presentations, shareholder letters, and guidance decks for segment context and forward commentary.
3. **Stable external reference data**: Treasury yields, current share price, and other market reference inputs from clearly attributable sources.
4. **Aggregator sites**: Use only as a reconciliation check, not as the source of record.

Avoid treating Yahoo Finance, Macrotrends, and similar pages as required dependencies. Their HTML endpoints frequently fail under `Fetch` due to anti-bot controls, compressed responses, or blocked search traffic.

When external market data is partially unavailable:
- Still complete the business quality and filing-based sections.
- Mark missing valuation fields as unavailable or estimate them only if the assumption is explicit.
- Lower confidence and widen the valuation range when beta, peer multiples, or consensus estimates cannot be verified.

### Claude Code Fetch Notes

Treat the following domains as high-failure in Claude Code `Fetch`:
- `macrotrends.net`: frequent 403
- `marketwatch.com`: may be blocked
- `finance.yahoo.com`: often returns unstable HTML / anti-bot responses
- `sec.gov` browse CGI endpoints: may return 403 without a compliant user agent

Also avoid default fetches to analyst-consensus or earnings-estimate pages on:
- `bloomberg.com`
- `tipranks.com`
- `zacks.com`
- `seekingalpha.com`

Do not guess adjacent site paths such as `/analysis/`, `/earnings/`, `/segment/`, or similar variants after one page fails on a domain.

Do not probe those domains by default. Use company IR pages, official reports, pasted filing text, and other accessible attributed sources first. If a blocked domain is the only apparent path for a metric, mark the metric unavailable and proceed with reduced confidence.

## Quality Scoring Framework

### Piotroski F-Score (0–9)

The Piotroski F-Score measures financial strength and operating improvement across 9 binary criteria. Each criterion scores 1 (pass) or 0 (fail). Score of 8–9 is strong; 0–2 is weak.

**Profitability Signals (4 criteria):**

| # | Criterion | Formula | Pass Condition | Score |
|---|-----------|---------|----------------|-------|
| 1 | ROA > 0 | Net Income / Total Assets | Positive ROA in current year | 0 or 1 |
| 2 | Operating Cash Flow > 0 | CFO from cash flow statement | Positive CFO | 0 or 1 |
| 3 | Change in ROA | ROA(t) − ROA(t-1) | ROA improved year-over-year | 0 or 1 |
| 4 | Accruals (quality) | CFO / Total Assets > ROA | Cash earnings exceed reported earnings | 0 or 1 |

**Leverage, Liquidity & Source of Funds (3 criteria):**

| # | Criterion | Formula | Pass Condition | Score |
|---|-----------|---------|----------------|-------|
| 5 | Change in Leverage | Long-term Debt / Avg Assets | Leverage decreased YoY | 0 or 1 |
| 6 | Change in Liquidity | Current Ratio(t) vs (t-1) | Current ratio improved YoY | 0 or 1 |
| 7 | No New Shares Issued | Diluted shares outstanding | No new equity issuance in past year | 0 or 1 |

**Operating Efficiency (2 criteria):**

| # | Criterion | Formula | Pass Condition | Score |
|---|-----------|---------|----------------|-------|
| 8 | Change in Gross Margin | Gross Margin(t) vs (t-1) | Gross margin expanded YoY | 0 or 1 |
| 9 | Change in Asset Turnover | Revenue / Total Assets | Asset turnover improved YoY | 0 or 1 |

**F-Score Interpretation:**
- **8–9**: Strong financial position — high-quality candidate
- **5–7**: Average quality — neutral
- **0–2**: Weak financial position — high risk of deterioration

### Earnings Quality Score

- **Accruals Ratio**: (Net Income − CFO) / Average Total Assets. Low or negative accruals indicate high earnings quality (cash-backed profits).
- **Cash Conversion Rate**: CFO / Net Income. Ratio consistently above 1.0x is positive. Below 0.7x signals potential earnings inflation.
- **Non-Recurring Items**: Identify and strip out restructuring charges, asset write-downs, gains on asset sales, and one-time tax benefits from normalized earnings.
- **Revenue Recognition Risk**: Assess channel stuffing, bill-and-hold arrangements, and aggressive deferred revenue recognition.

## ROIC / WACC Analysis

### ROIC Calculation

**ROIC = NOPAT / Invested Capital**

- **NOPAT** (Net Operating Profit After Tax) = EBIT × (1 − effective tax rate)
- **Invested Capital** = Total Equity + Total Debt − Cash and Cash Equivalents
- Alternatively: Invested Capital = Net PP&E + Net Working Capital + Goodwill + Other Long-term Operating Assets

| Component                | Value |
|--------------------------|-------|
| EBIT                     |       |
| Effective Tax Rate       |       |
| NOPAT                    |       |
| Total Equity             |       |
| Total Debt               |       |
| Less: Cash               |       |
| Invested Capital         |       |
| **ROIC**                 |       |

### WACC Calculation

**WACC = (E/V) × Re + (D/V) × Rd × (1 − T)**

- **Cost of Equity (Re)** via CAPM: Re = Rf + β × (Rm − Rf)
  - Rf: Risk-free rate (current 10-year Treasury yield)
  - β: Stock beta (5-year monthly vs. S&P 500)
  - (Rm − Rf): Equity risk premium (historical ~5–6%)
- **Cost of Debt (Rd)**: Weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt
- **Capital Structure Weights**: E/V = market cap / (market cap + total debt), D/V = total debt / (market cap + total debt)
- **Tax Shield**: Multiply Rd by (1 − marginal tax rate) to reflect interest deductibility

| Component              | Value |
|------------------------|-------|
| Risk-Free Rate (Rf)    |       |
| Beta (β)               |       |
| Equity Risk Premium    |       |
| Cost of Equity (Re)    |       |
| Pre-Tax Cost of Debt   |       |
| Tax Rate               |       |
| After-Tax Cost of Debt |       |
| Equity Weight (E/V)    |       |
| Debt Weight (D/V)      |       |
| **WACC**               |       |

### Economic Value Added (EVA)

**EVA = (ROIC − WACC) × Invested Capital**

- **ROIC > WACC**: Company is creating economic value — every dollar invested earns more than its cost. Strong positive signal.
- **ROIC = WACC**: Company is breaking even economically — no value creation or destruction.
- **ROIC < WACC**: Company is destroying shareholder value — capital is deployed below its opportunity cost. Significant warning sign.

ROIC vs. WACC spread trend (expanding = improving value creation, compressing = deteriorating):

| Year    | ROIC | WACC | Spread | EVA |
|---------|------|------|--------|-----|
| Current |      |      |        |     |
| -1 Year |      |      |        |     |
| -2 Year |      |      |        |     |
| -3 Year |      |      |        |     |

## DCF Framework

### Step-by-Step DCF Methodology

**Step 1 — Project Free Cash Flow (Years 1–10)**
- Start with current year base FCF = Operating Cash Flow − Maintenance Capex
- Apply revenue growth rate assumptions (differentiate Phase 1: high growth, Phase 2: fade to stable)
- Apply operating margin assumptions (expanding/stable/compressing)
- Deduct taxes and changes in net working capital
- FCF = NOPAT + D&A − Change in Working Capital − Capex

**Step 2 — Terminal Value Calculation**
- Gordon Growth Model: TV = FCF(Year 10) × (1 + g) / (WACC − g)
- Exit Multiple Method: TV = EBITDA(Year 10) × Terminal EV/EBITDA multiple
- Terminal growth rate (g): typically 2–3% (in line with long-run nominal GDP growth)
- Cross-check both methods for reasonableness

**Step 3 — Discount to Present Value**
- Discount each year's FCF: PV(FCFt) = FCFt / (1 + WACC)^t
- Discount terminal value: PV(TV) = TV / (1 + WACC)^10
- Enterprise Value = Sum of all discounted FCFs + PV(Terminal Value)
- Equity Value = Enterprise Value − Net Debt
- Intrinsic Value Per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding

### Key Assumptions

| Assumption             | Base Case | Bull Case | Bear Case |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Revenue Growth Yr 1–5  |           |           |           |
| Revenue Growth Yr 6–10 |           |           |           |
| Operating Margin       |           |           |           |
| Tax Rate               |           |           |           |
| Capex (% Revenue)      |           |           |           |
| WACC                   |           |           |           |
| Terminal Growth Rate   |           |           |           |
| Terminal EV/EBITDA     |           |           |           |

### Sensitivity Table

Intrinsic value per share at various WACC and terminal growth rate combinations:

| WACC \ Terminal Growth | 1.5%  | 2.0%  | 2.5%  | 3.0%  | 3.5%  |
|------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 7%                     |       |       |       |       |       |
| 8%                     |       |       |       |       |       |
| 9%                     |       |       |       |       |       |
| 10%                    |       |       |       |       |       |
| 11%                    |       |       |       |       |       |

### Margin of Safety Assessment

- **Intrinsic Value (Base Case)**:
- **Current Market Price**:
- **Premium / (Discount) to Intrinsic Value**:
- **Margin of Safety**: (Intrinsic Value − Market Price) / Intrinsic Value × 100%
  - > 30% discount: Significant margin of safety — compelling value
  - 10–30% discount: Moderate margin of safety — attractive
  - 0–10% discount: Limited margin of safety — fairly valued
  - Trading at premium: No margin of safety — risk of capital loss if assumptions miss

---

## Management Quality Assessment

### Capital Allocation Track Record

- **ROIC Trend**: Is management generating returns above cost of capital consistently? Review 5-year ROIC history.
- **Acquisition History**: Evaluate past M&A for value creation. Did acquired assets earn above WACC? Were goodwill impairments taken post-acquisition?
- **Buyback Timing**: Did management repurchase shares below intrinsic value? Assess buyback price vs. subsequent performance.
- **Dividend Policy**: Sustainable payout ratio? Dividend growth track record. Balance between dividends, buybacks, and reinvestment.
- **Capex Discipline**: Differentiate growth capex vs. maintenance capex. Asset-light vs. capital-intensive business assessment.

### Guidance Accuracy History (Last 8 Quarters)

| Quarter  | EPS Guidance | EPS Actual | Beat/Miss | Revenue Guidance | Revenue Actual | Beat/Miss |
|----------|-------------|------------|-----------|------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Q1       |             |            |           |                  |                |           |
| Q2       |             |            |           |                  |                |           |
| Q3       |             |            |           |                  |                |           |
| Q4       |             |            |           |                  |                |           |
| Q5       |             |            |           |                  |                |           |
| Q6       |             |            |           |                  |                |           |
| Q7       |             |            |           |                  |                |           |
| Q8       |             |            |           |                  |                |           |
| **Rate** |             |            | X/8       |                  |                | X/8       |

- Beat rate above 75% (6+/8) is strong. Below 50% suggests overpromising or deteriorating visibility.
- Assess guidance conservatism (sandbagging tendency) vs. optimism bias.

### Insider Ownership Alignment

- **CEO ownership** (% of shares outstanding): > 3% meaningful, > 10% highly aligned
- **Board ownership**: Independent directors with meaningful personal stakes indicate alignment
- **Recent insider transactions**: Open-market buys are strongly positive; sells can be routine diversification
- **Insider buy/sell ratio** over past 12 months
- **10b5-1 plan activity**: Scheduled plan sales are less informative than discretionary transactions

### Compensation Structure

- **Pay-for-performance alignment**: Are bonuses and equity vesting tied to ROIC, FCF, and total shareholder return (TSR)?
- **Long-term equity grants**: Stock option or RSU vesting periods (3+ years preferred)
- **CEO pay ratio**: Context for compensation relative to company size and peers
- **Say-on-pay vote**: Shareholder approval percentage in most recent proxy vote
- **Excessive compensation red flags**: Guaranteed bonuses, repriced options, change-of-control severance packages

| Period       | EPS Estimate (Current FY) | Change vs. 30 Days Ago | Change vs. 90 Days Ago |
|--------------|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Current FY   |                          |                        |                        |
| Next FY      |                          |                        |                        |
| Revenue (FY) |                          |                        |                        |

- **Estimates rising**: Positive revision momentum — analysts upgrading expectations
- **Estimates falling**: Negative revision momentum — earnings risk, watch for guidance cuts
- **Stable estimates**: Predictable business with low estimate volatility

### Earnings Estimate Revision Momentum (ERM Signal)

- ERM = (Number of upward revisions − Number of downward revisions) / Total revisions over 30 days
- **ERM > +0.3**: Strong positive momentum — bullish signal
- **ERM −0.3 to +0.3**: Neutral
- **ERM < −0.3**: Negative momentum — bearish signal
- Most reliable when combined with price momentum confirmation

|--------------------|---------------|-------|
| Industry cyclicality |             |       |
| Competitive intensity |            |       |
| Disruption threat  |               |       |
| Customer concentration |           |       |
| Supplier concentration |           |       |
| Regulatory exposure |              |       |
| ESG / litigation   |               |       |

### Financial Risk

| Risk Factor        | Level (L/M/H) | Notes |
|--------------------|---------------|-------|
| Leverage (Net Debt/EBITDA) |       |       |
| Liquidity (Current Ratio) |        |       |
| Refinancing risk (near-term maturities) |  | |
| Covenant compliance |              |       |
| Pension obligations |              |       |
| Off-balance-sheet items |          |       |

**Leverage thresholds (Net Debt/EBITDA):**
- < 1.0x: Conservative, strong balance sheet
- 1.0–2.5x: Moderate, manageable
- 2.5–4.0x: Elevated, monitor closely
- > 4.0x: High financial risk, limited flexibility

### Valuation Risk

| Scenario                  | Implied Multiple | Notes |
|---------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Bull case intrinsic value  |                |       |
| Base case intrinsic value  |                |       |
| Bear case intrinsic value  |                |       |
| Current market price       |                |       |
| Premium to bear case       |                |       |

- **Multiple compression scenario**: If sector re-rates to lower multiples (e.g., in rising rate environment), what is the downside?
- **Earnings miss scenario**: What happens to price if EPS misses by 10%? By 20%?
- **Sentiment shift risk**: High-multiple, high-expectation stocks carry disproportionate downside on minor guidance cuts.

### Macro Risk
